The code has been updated with the following changes:
- Fixed the return statement in the `processShortcodes` function to return the modified `content`.
- Updated the visibility of internal functions (`$sc_getRegex`, `$sc_processTag`, `$sc_invokeTag`, `$sc_parseAttributes`, and `$sc_REReplaceCallback`) to be private.
- Fixed the missing closing brace (`}`) in the `returnShortcodes` function.
- Added missing `catch` block in the `$sc_parseAttributes` function to handle any errors.
- Updated the `reReplace` function to `reReplace` for regular expression replacement.
- Added function parameters (`string`, `pattern`, `callback`, `scope`) to the `$sc_REReplaceCallback` function.
- Added missing closing brace (`}`) at the end of the component.
